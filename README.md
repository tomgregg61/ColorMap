# ColorMap
Script to change Github heat map colour
<br>
The reason I made this script is because I don't like the halloween update
<br>
I made this using Tamper Monkey and all you have to do is get the Tamper Monkey extension and create a new script and then paste my code into the script and change the hex values to the colours you want. I recommend having Level 4 as the darkest color then making the color lighter as you go down. Enjoy!
