# ColorMap
<h2>Script to change Github heat map colour</h2>
This work builds off of information i found from 2019 on this site: https://dev.to/abdurrahmaanj/how-to-change-your-github-contribution-graph-colour-to-something-cool-34gg <br><br>
The reason I made this script is because I don't like the halloween update
<br><br>
I made this using Tamper Monkey. To use get the Tamper Monkey chrome extension and create a new script, and then paste my code in and change the hex values to the colours you want. I recommend having Level 4 as the darkest color then making the color lighter as you go down. Enjoy!
